This is a very simple script to fetch newest YLE news broadcast as an M3U
playlist. Original motivation for this was to be able to wake up listening 
the news. I already had an app that woke me with Internet radio (Gentle Alarm
for Android) so I only needed the playlist generator part. There is a hosted
version of this thing running at my  web server, where you can use it if 
you don't want to host it yourself:

There are a few TODOs marked in code I might implement one day and you can
leave development suggestions as github issues or fork them if you wish.
I hope this is of use for someone.

Installation
------------

Just clone it to any php-enabled web server and it should just work(TM):
https://github.com/maakuth/ylenews-m3u.git

Common issues
-------------

For some ludicrous reason, for example Android media players need to have
m3u url that actually ends "m3u", and that is why you need to have "?m3u"
at the end of your url. With sufficiently smart browser (try Chrome with
VLC plugin) you'll be fine just pointing to that directory.
